# üìù Singly Linked List: Add Element at the Start

This Python program demonstrates the implementation of a **Singly Linked List** where a new element can be added at the **start** of the list.

---

## üéØ Aim

To write a Python program that adds a **new element** at the **start** of a singly linked list. The program implements a `push_front` method that inserts an element at the front of the list, followed by a method to print the list.

---

## üß† Algorithm

1. **Step 1:** Define a class `Node` with:
   - `data` to store the node's value.
   - `next` to store the reference to the next node.
   
2. **Step 2:** Define a class `LinkedList` with:
   - `head` to point to the first node.
   
3. **Step 3:** In the `LinkedList` class, define a method `push_front(newElement)`:
   - Create a new node with `newElement`.
   - Set the new node's next pointer to the current head node.
   - Set the head to the new node.

4. **Step 4:** Define a method `PrintList()` to display the list:
   - Print the elements of the list or display "The list is empty." if the list is empty.

5. **Step 5:** Instantiate a `LinkedList` object, `MyList`, and add elements at the start using the `push_front()` method.

6. **Step 6:** Call the `PrintList()` method to display the list.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def push_front(self, newElement):
        new_node = Node(newElement)  # Create a new node
        new_node.next = self.head     # Point the new node's next to the current head
        self.head = new_node         # Update head to the new node

    def PrintList(self):
        temp = self.head
        if(temp != None):
            print("The list contains:", end=" ")
            while (temp != None):
                print(temp.data, end=" ")
                temp = temp.next
            print()
        else:
            print("The list is empty.")

# Creating a linked list and pushing elements at the front
MyList = LinkedList()

MyList.push_front(10)
MyList.push_front(20)
MyList.push_front(30)

# Printing the list
MyList.PrintList()
